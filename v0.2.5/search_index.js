We do that via the sds_name arg.\n\nIn simpler cases the variable to be interpolated lays down on a 2D array but it is also possible that it is stored in a 3D array. If that is the case, use the keyword 'band' to select a band (ex: 'band=2') Bands are numbered from 1.\n\nThe interpolation is done so far with 'nearneighbor'. Both the region (-R) and increment (-I) are estimated from data but they can be set with region and inc kwargs as well. One can also set the 'nearneighbor' serach radius with option search_radius. The defaul is to set search_radius equal to two times the average increment.\n\nFor MODIS data we can select the quality flag to filter by data quality. By default the best quality (=0) is used, but one can select another with the quality=val kwarg. Positive 'val' values select data of quality <= quality, whilst negative 'val' values select only data with quality >= abs(val). This allows for example to extract only the cloud coverage.\n\nIf instead of calculating a grid (returned as a GMTgrid type) user wants the x,y,z data intself, use the keywords dataset, or outxyz and the output will be in a GMTdataset (i.e. use dataset=true).\n\nTo inquire just the list of available arrays use list=true or gdalinfo=true to get the full file info.\n\nExamples:\n\nG = grid_at_sensor(\"AQUA_MODIS.20020717T135006.L2.SST.nc\", \"sst\", V=true);\n\nG = grid_at_sensor(\"TXx-narr-annual-timavg.nc\", \"T2MAX\", xarray=\"XLONG\", yarray=\"XLAT\", V=true);\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"function"},{"location":"#RemoteS.mndwi-Tuple{Any, Any}","page":"Index","title":"RemoteS.mndwi","text":"MNDWI = mndwi(green, swir2; kw...)\n\nor\n\nMNDWI = mndwi(cube::String; [bands=Int[], bandnames=String[], layers=Int[]], kwargs...)\n\nModified Normalised Difference Water Index.
